# Base64 Decode Popup
This utility displays the contents of Base64 and Base64Url encoded strings
selected in files.

# To Install
This plugin is not yet available on package control. Until it is, manual
installation can be performed by:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate to your package installation directory (You can do this by opening
sublime text and Navigating to `Preferences` --> `Browse Packages`).
4. Copy the contents of this repo into a new folder called
`base64-decode-popup`.

Optionally, if you are using Linux, just run `install.sh`, which will do the
same thing.
